This is an xdvdfs (xbox iso) file creation/extraction utility for linux/darwin/
freebsd.

If you want to port it to your OS it shouldn't be too hard, just make sure your
fseek/ftell takes 64-bit file offsets.

I wrote this code completely from scratch today because xbiso (the one on
sourceforge) keeps seg-faulting and the code is buggy.  I got useful
documentation on the xdvdfs file system from http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net.

I will say thanks though to the author of xbiso, it was a good start and got me
thinking!


Regarding licensing:

I think the GPL sucks!  (it stands for Generosity Poor License)

My open-source code is really *FREE* so you can do whatever you want with it, as
long as 1) you don't claim that you wrote my code and 2) you retain a notice
that some parts of the code are copyright in@fishtank.com and 3) you understand
there are no warranties.  I only guarantee that it will take up disk space!

If you want to help out with this project it would be welcome, just email me at
in@fishtank.com.
